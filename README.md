# Hi. I'm Hassan Raza

A Full-Stack Developer with 2+ years of hands-on experience building fast, scalable, and production-ready applications. From crafting robust Django backends to designing clean and responsive ReactJS frontends, and deploying to Linux servers — I handle projects from concept to deployment.

Whether it’s scraping millions of records, automating headless browsers, or building dashboards and APIs, I bring a solution-first mindset and solid technical foundation to every project.
